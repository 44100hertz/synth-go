* GBA Specs
** CPU/RAM
 - ARM7TDMI @ 16.78 MHz, Zilog Z80 @ 8 or 4 MHz
 - 32 KB internal, 256 KB external, 96 KB VRAM

** Video
 - TFT LCD, 240 Ã— 160 pixels, 15-bit RGB color
 - Four 4bpp or 256-color 2^n size square canvases that draw 8x8 tiles
 - Tiles drawn onscreen
   - Tile memory stores the location of all onscreen tiles
   - Scroll offset controls location of screen on tilemap
   - BG can be given affine transform
 - OAM "object attribute memory" is transformable, automatically-drawn sprites
   - Stores position, size, flipping flag, depth priority 0-4
   - Sprites are rotated/scaled/sheared using affine matrix
 - Two 256-color palettes
 - Builtin graphical effects
   - Mosaic pixelization effect, per-sprite or per-layer
   - Blending; fade to white, fade to black, and alpha blend
   - Windowing; allows the screen to be divided into areas

** Audio
*** GBC
 1. Square with sweep, len, duty, env, freq, on
 2. Square with len, duty, env, freq, on
 3. Custom 64-bit (16x4bit) Wave
 4. Noise with len, vol, env, freq, on
Separate table for left volume, right volume,
left and right volume of each channel.

*** GBA
Two stereo mixers for point-resampled direct stereo channels.

** Misc
 - 128 Sprites made out of tiles
 - DMA; "Direct memory access"
   - Halts the CPU and allows data to be copied quickly, mostly for sound and video.
   - Can be triggered by HSYNC for graphical effects
   - 0 - high-priority
   - 1 and 2 - Sound
   - 3 - General purpose
 - Timers; various power-of-two cycle counters
 - Interrupts; switching execution to some given code on an event, before switching back
 - BIOS calls for system operations, other common operations, music playback

** Input
 - "10 keys" in order: L R down up left right start select B A

* Video
* Audio
Wavetable pairs with envelope, FIR rectangular filter, and delay line.
Any size wave bank, but be aware: it's always loaded into memory.
** Modes
 - Stereo :: Play one sample in each channel.
 - PM :: Wave out left -> Phase right.
 - AM :: Wave out left -> Amplitude right.
 - Hard Sync :: Phase left -> Phase right.
** Params
 - Mode
 - Volume, slide
 - LFO; volume, speed, mode (tremolo, vibrato, off)
 - Wave offset, length
 - Pitch, slide
 - FIR pitch, slide, length 2^n, influence
 - Delay offset, volume
 - Delay volume
 - Loop mode (0=off, 1=forward, 2=pingpong)
 - Delay mode (0=off, 1=normal, 2=pingpong)
** Lazy FIR
An extremely lazy FIR filter. Stores 2^n values, uses a rolling average.
Will not store more than one value per sample; speed limited by sample rate.
Should not actually suck because it's pitched, so produces harmonic noises.
"Lazy" because doesn't recalculate anything when the pitch changes.
** Delay line
Simply samples a single previous value.
