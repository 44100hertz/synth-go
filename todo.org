** TODO design a nice way to pass around sequence-able data
Current idea bouncing around: Make the mixer's meaningful data into
Exported data, then pass the mixer by reference and let the user
modify it however. For internal data that is useful to reference but
not meant to be modified, implement getters.

** TODO more mixer functionality, e.g. what's in spec
** TODO set mixer timing based on sequence length
** TODO sends
