** DONE design a nice way to pass around sequence-able data
Current idea bouncing around: Make the mixer's meaningful data into
Exported data, then pass the mixer by reference and let the user
modify it however. For internal data that is useful to reference but
not meant to be modified, implement getters.

Done: Things get exported in a way that can be modified. No getters
though. User is free to break things, and that's okay. It's obvious
what's meant to be touched, at least so far.
** TODO stereo mixer!!
** TODO better range checking to squash bugs
Go ahead, try delay a wave that doesn't get shut off.
Also, it's probably bad to mix by negative values?
** TODO more mixer functionality, e.g. what's in spec
 - [X] Wave index, offset, length. Passed to wave callback, length used
   for looping.
 - [X] Volume, slide. Affects effects.
 - [X] Mixer Volume, slide. Applied after effects.
 - [X] Note Pitch, slide
 - [ ] LFO; level, speed, mode (volume(T), pitch(V), both, off)
 - [X] IIR pitch, slide, length 2^n, level
 - [X] Delay offset, volume
 - [ ] Loop mode (off, normal, swap)
 - [ ] Delay mode (off, forward, pingpong)
 - [ ] ADSR envelope for each note
** DONE make delay and filter samplerate independant
 - [X] Set the delay in number of ticks.
 - [X] Update the delay every tick based on the tickrate/bpm aswell.
 - [ ] Set filter based on length in Âµs
^ Actually, this can't work! Reasonable filters are limited as heck!
I'd say just double or halve the filter based on sample rate, just to
make it a bit more consistant. It's the best you can do.
** DONE integrate IIR as extension to delay
** TODO proper channel pairs
** TODO mixer close timing
The mixer needs to explicitly know when to close
** TODO sends
Override some channel data calculation and replace the contents of that channel
with some given data.
Sending left will preserve effects, etc. Sending right will play back raw.
** TODO chip mode vs sample mode
Make channel use either absolute pitch or relative pitch
** TODO create mixer demo, sequence gen helpers
** TODO context interface, create one with wave out

* Optimizations
** TODO assess converting things to 32-bit
It would help portability a lot to use 32bit numbers. In addition, it
keeps things more limited and less likely to break.

* Video
** TODO create video initialization, cleanly with audio
