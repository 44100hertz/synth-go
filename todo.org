** TODO design a nice way to pass around sequence-able data
Current idea bouncing around: Make the mixer's meaningful data into
Exported data, then pass the mixer by reference and let the user
modify it however. For internal data that is useful to reference but
not meant to be modified, implement getters.
** TODO more mixer functionality, e.g. what's in spec
** TODO mixer close timing
The mixer needs to explicitly know when to close
** TODO sends
Override some channel data calculation and replace the contents of that channel
with some given data.
Sending left will preserve effects, etc. Sending right will play back raw.
** TODO chip mode vs sample mode
Make channel use either absolute pitch or relative pitch
